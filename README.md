# Quantitative Spatial Economics Models in Julia

These are my attempts at running QSE models in Julia. This repository is mostly aspirational, since I added quite a lot of papers that employ this methodology and is highly unlikely that I (alone) will ever replicate them all. The goal is to discuss the steps and decisions made by the authors while replicating their findings.

It follows the "roadmap" of this repository:
- [X] [Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017)](https://github.com/phchavesmaia/QSE-models/tree/main/models/redding_rossihansberg-2017)
- [X] [Monte, Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2018)](https://github.com/phchavesmaia/QSE-models/tree/main/models/monte_etal-2018)
- [ ] Tsivanidis (2025)
- [ ] HÃ¶rcher and Graham (2024)
