# Monte, Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2018)

This repository replicates Seidel and Wickerath (2020) implementation of the Monte, Redding, and Rossi-Hansberg (2018) model in Julia. It is **largely** based on the Ahfeldt and Seidel (2024) replication toolkit.

As emphasized by Ahfeldt and Seidel (2024) in their original implementation, the descriptive analyses and counterfactual exercises are for didactic purposes and unrelated to the research papers. Thus, this Julia implementation replicates the toolkit but does not reproduce results from either study.
