# Quantitative Spatial Economics Models in Julia

These are my attempts at running QSE models in Julia. This repository is mostly aspirational, since I added quite a lot of papers that employ this methodology and is highly unlikely I (alone) will ever replicate them all. The goal is to discuss the steps and decisions made by the authors while replicating their findings.

It follows the "roadmap" of this repository:
- [X] Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017)
- [ ] Monte, Redding, Rossi-Hansberg (2018)
- [ ] Tsivanidis (2025)
- [ ] HÃ¶rcher and Graham (2024)
