# Monde, Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2018)

This folder aims to replicate the Seidel and Wickerath (2020) implementation of the Monde, Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2018) model in Julia. My efforts are heavily based on Ahfeldt and Seidel (2024) replication toolkit, of which I uploaded the corresponding codebook explaining the algorithims in this repository.
